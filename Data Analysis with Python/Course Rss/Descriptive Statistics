Helps to Describe of the data set and summarises the data 
We can use describe() in pandas 
    df.describe()
Summerize the categorical data is by using the value_count() method 

Box Plots 
Great way to visualise data .It shows 
    Median of the day 
    Upper and lower Quartile
    Lower and upper Extreme
    eg:
        sns.boxplot(x=drive-wheels,y="price",data=df)

Scatter Plot 
Each observation rep as points
shows relationship between 2 variable 
    1. predictor variable (engine size) on x-axis.
    2. Target/dependent(y) variable on y-axis

Python Implmentation 
x,y=df["price"],df["engine-size"]
plt.title("Engine Size vs Price")
plt.xlabel("Engine size")
plt.ylabel("price")

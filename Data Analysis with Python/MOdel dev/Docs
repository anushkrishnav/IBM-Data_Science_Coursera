A model or estimator can be thought of as a mathematical equation used to predict the value given one or more other values. 
Relating one or more independent variables or features to dependent variables.

Types of Model Development
Simple  Linear Regression 
    one independednt variable to make prediction
    End goal : this equation y=b0+ b1*X
        Where b0 is the intercept 
              b1 is the slope
Multiple Linear Regression
    multiple independednt variables
Polynomail Linear Regression
